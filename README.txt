1. Megaman's image shows him going left when he goes left vice versa with right
2. Megaman's image changes to him shooting right when he attacks, vice versa with left
3. Changed gameboard.py to allow animation of the attack and background. Portals hold the current room, connection, and background of that room.
4. Tasks can be partially completed, for example, if I had to defeat 5 protomans, and I deafeated 1 so far,
the task bar will show that one needs to kill 4 more protomans.
5. There is a boss room when all the tasks are finished, it is up to you to find out what it is if you're curious enough :]
